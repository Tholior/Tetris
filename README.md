# Tetris Clone (Raylib)

A simple clone of the classic Tetris game, built using the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) C++ library.

> Created as part of a learning journey using development guide. This project helped me understand how to manage game states, handle user input, and implement basic 2D rendering and logic.

## ðŸŽ® Features
- Classic Tetris gameplay: falling blocks, rotation, line clearing
- Basic scoring system
- Game over detection

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Game loop structure in C++
- Handling input using Raylib
- Block collision and grid system logic
